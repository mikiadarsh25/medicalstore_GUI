# medicalstore_GUI

In this Python project, we will build a GUI-based School Management System using the Tkinter, SQLite3, and TkCalender libraries and messagebox and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. It is an intermediate level project, where you will learn how to use databases and make some great GUIs in Python and apply them in real life. Let’s start!😊

The objective of this is to create a GUI based Medicine Store Management System. To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of Tkinter library and SQLite API and basic understanding of TkCalender, Datetime libraries, messagebox and Ttk modules.


# About Medicine Store Management System:

Medicine Store Management Systems manage all the information of the patients medine purchase records.
In our project, we will only use it to manage some basic personal information of the patientl.

# About the project:

The objective of this is to create a GUI based School Management System. To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of Tkinter library and SQLite API and basic understanding of TkCalender, Datetime libraries, messagebox and Ttk modules.

# Project Prerequisites:

To build this project, we will need the following libraries:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.
2. SQLite3 – To connect the program to the database and store information in it.
3. TkCalender – To get the user to enter a date.
4. Datetime.date – To convert the date from the tree to a Datetime.date instance so that it can be set in.
5. Tkinter.messagebox – To show a display box, displaying some information or an error.
6. Tkinter.ttk – To create the tree where all the information will be displayed.

# Project File Structure:

Here are the steps you will need to execute to build this project:
1. Importing all the necessary libraries and modules.
2. Initializing the GUI window and placing the components in it.
3. Defining the functions to manipulate the data in the database and the tree.
